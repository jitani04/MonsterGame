# MonsterGame
A python project with examples of Object Oriented Programming and design patterns. I implement multiple classes and use inheritance, abstraction, enapsulation, and the factory design pattern and abstract classes and methods. The functions simulate a game where a traveler, the user, travels through a map and encounters different monsters. 
## How to run
The project can be ran by downloading the files and running main.py and inputing values when prompted.
